For the analysis I will be using the package "caret" (https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html)

The goal is to let the user input the amount of features he expects to keep. The default number will be the initial amount divided by 10.

First of all, we need to preprocess the data, because we have way too many variables to actually make a FS algorithm work (R works with RAM, so with our 8GB we can't even do any calculation with the initial data).
We'll use Fisher's linear discriminant score as a preprocesser to eliminate much of the data. Fisher's linear discriminant ratio for a variable with classes 1 and 2 = (mean(1) - mean(2))^2 / (len(1)*var(1) + len(2)*var(2)). The length is important because this way we can take into consideration the class samples' ratio. We will take the biggest scores out of that.
It is nice to have a plot of the scores this function outputs so as to see maybe patterns or big slopes in the data that makes us rethink about the amount of features we want to take, or just for pure interest.


According to V.Bol√≥n-Canedo et. al., RelieF is one of the best FS algorithms so we'll see how it behaves for us, using the CORElearn package.
There are many ways to apply it, but we will provide two: ReliefFequalK and ReliefFexpRank. For the first one, K nearest instances have the same weight. For the second one, the weights of the same rank decrease exponentially.
We have an 8GB RAM and the data it wants to allocate 11GB using that algorithm, so we will need to use another one to reduce the number of features before using that one.


It will be nice to use CIM plots to represent the results.
